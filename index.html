			<h2>Some Weblog Thing</h2>
			<p>by Jonathan Pinlac</p>
		</header>
		<p>So what the heck is a weblog? A weblog is what a blog used to be. In the past they were simply websites that contained informal journal entries. Now the modern interpretation of a blog can somewhat be intimidating. Well I'm probably projecting right now, more specifically writing a blog is intimidating to me.</p>
		<p>I've come to see blogs to be the podium of subject matter experts, and inspiring people. Who am I to publish anything that isn't worty of such praise? I'm not a subject matter expert, I'm not a great writer, nor do I lead a particulary interesting life at the moment. But I find that a blog may be the perfect medium to help myslef grow.</p>
		<p>Sure maybe someday I'll have achieved some great things in my life. Maybe help a bunch of people find happiness in their own lives. But these are such lofty goals it can be dizzying to figure out where to start. So for now I'll start with this blog. Progress starts with just one small step.</p>
		<h3>About this blog</h3>
		<p>Have you ever saw another person's work and have your mind shattered into such small insignificant pieces that you're then discouraged to try anything yourself? Yeah that sucks. The thing is, you see the good parts, but never the bad or ugly.</p>
		</p>Everybody who's good at their craft started somewhere and it wasn't pretty. It's usually so bad most people are unwilling to even share it. This blog will be an exception, I hope to chronicle my development as programmer, writer, and in every other random thing I find interesting.</p>
		<p>For all the nerds out there, I plan to incorporate a timeline of major revisions to this site so you can see how my skills will develop. Nobody has time to clone and setup some person's old and crusty github repo to check out some old work so I'll make it easy for you. :)</p> 
		<p>Thank you for being awesome, <br><i>Jonathan Pinlac</i></p>
