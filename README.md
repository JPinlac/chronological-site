# My Chronological Blog
A blog that also showcases my growth as a developer with a timeline of revisions

### Version 0.0 11/9/2015
First personal site that just used bootstrap with a freelancer them to basically host an online resume.

###  Version 0.42 2/10/2016
A portfolio site showcasing what I've learned. Although I have had some experience with Angular at this point, this site featured some responsive design and animations from scratch.

###  Version 1.0 9/10/2016
At this point I have a bit of experience with iOS apps and decided to start a blog. It's around this point that I have enough experience programming and I just need to go out and actually build something. Of course trying to build your own CMS is somewhat daunting so I've procrastinated a bit on this, so I decided to take that first small step and do a super simple first blog post.
