                <h2>Programming as a Means to an End</h2>
                <p>November 29th, 2016</p>
            </header>
            <p>I've been in a huge rut. There have been numerous of questions that have stopped me from moving forward.
                Like how do I become a better programmer, why am I writing this blog again, why do I procrastinate so
                much, why is it so easy to be lazy. I guess what I'm trying to get it, is it's easy to get lost and
                distracted. It happens so often with me that I end up with 1000 different hobbies and random domain
                knowledge.</p>

            <p class="brain-puke puke">In today's modern society it's hard to find a purpose. Day to day stresses are such
                inane things compared to the stresses of old. We don't have to worry about hunting for food for the next
                few days, or securing water. Now we worry about why am I so bored, or direct those stresses to things
                that simply don't matter.</p>
            <p class="idea-note note">This new tag <span class="brain-puke-icon"></span>is for me. As I start writing I realize
                there's some interesting tangents I would like to explore, but they aren't relevant to the topic at hand.
                I'm ear marking them for later use, and allowing a way for those precious ideas to flow like butter.</p>
            <p class="site-puke puke">I'm starting to envision making this blog into some type of writing tool. The idea is to
                have the ability to take snippets of text and save them into buckets. Like right now, I would have buckets
                for brain-puke, topic ideas, development ideas. There's crazy things you could do with this like, have your
                audience vote for the next topic in your bucket. Most of all this would all be accessible easily in your
                writing flow. I'm finding the ideas keep coming when I start writing. Crazy stuff. Private and public buckets,
                attach meta data like title, time conceived.</p>
            <p class="idea-note note">I have the idea to expand on the brain-puke idea into buckets. The buckets, including
                brain-puke, will be available for later use that could be interacted with later.</p>


            <p>All too often it's easy as a developer to confuse your job to solely be programming. Programming isn't your job,
                your job is to use the tools at your disposal to create things. That could be anything from tools,
                to applications, experiences, or whatever you like. Programming is simply a means to an end.</p>
            <p>Programming also happens to be one of those subjects where you can spend a lifetime learning about it's intricacies.
                Because of this it's easy to get caught up in \'learning\' programming. While this isn't a wrong way
                way to learn, it's horridly inefficient. Let's say your job is to be a basketball player. To become better at
                your job you could learn about the game, the theories, the strategies, the history. You will have uncertainly
                learned a lot, some of that may make you a better basketball player, but what if you spent that time and energy
                practicing playing the game?</p>
            <p>Programming is the same way. You can learn about programming or you can do it. So if you are stuck and not
                making any forward progress learning. Perhaps the best thing you can do is to just do it. </p>
            <p>Side note - I'm going to take the whole visibile iteration thing a step further and show how my posts develop
                draft by draft.</p>
            <p class="idea-note note ">Introducing idea notes! I want to expand on the idea of footnotes and have different viewing modes
                to highlight my other thinking processes. Let's say have one that highlights my writing process, or one for
                my thinking process. This specific <span class="idea-note-icon icon"></span>is to denote when I randomly get an
                idea and what it was while I was writing.</p>

                <h2>Some Weblog Thing</h2>
                <p>September 9th, 2016</p>
            </header>
            <p>So what the heck is a weblog? A weblog is what a blog used to be. In the past they were simply websites
                that contained informal journal entries. Now the modern interpretation of a blog can be somewhat
                intimidating. Well I'm mostly projecting right now, because writing a blog has been extremely intimidating
                to me.</p>
            <p>I've come to see blogs to be the podium of subject matter experts, and inspiring people. Who am I to
                publish anything that isn't worthy of such praise? I'm not a subject matter expert, I'm not a great
                writer, nor do I have the answer to life's difficult questions. But I find that a blog may be the
                perfect medium to help myself grow.</p>
            <p>Sure maybe someday I'll have achieved some great things in my life. Maybe help a bunch of people find
                happiness in their own lives. But these are such lofty goals it can be dizzying to figure out where to
                start. So for now I'll start with this blog. Progress starts with just one small step.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">About this blog</h3>
            <p>Have you ever saw another person's work and have your mind shattered into such small insignificant pieces
                that you're then discouraged to try anything yourself? Yeah it's depressing. The thing is, you see the good
                parts, but never the bad or the ugly.</p>
            <p>Everybody who's good at their craft started somewhere and it wasn't pretty. It's usually so bad most
                people are unwilling to even share it. This blog isn't an exception, this first version is as bare
                bones as it gets and it isn't pretty. But I know myself and I happen to easily be paralyzed by large
                projects so I start of with that small step. So here's the beginning of my blog, where I hope to chronicle my
                growth as programmer, writer, and in every other random thing I undertake. </p>
            <p>For all the nerds out there, I plan to incorporate a timeline of major revisions to this site so you can
                see how my skills develop. Nobody has time to clone and setup some person's old and crusty github repo
                to check out some old work so I'll make it easy for you. My first personal and portfolio site are up at
                the top of the site right now if you want to check them out.</p>
